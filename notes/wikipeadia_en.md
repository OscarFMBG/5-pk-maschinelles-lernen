# Notes
- facial recognition system = tech capable of id-ing or verifying a person from image or video source
- general principle = comparing facial features to entries in a database
- use of AI = subset of Biometric AI
- uses:
  - Computer Apps
  - Mobile Apps
  - Robotics
  - Security systems
    - lower accuracy than iris und fingerprint recognition
    - wide adoption because contactless, non-invasive
  - Commercial id-ing and marketing tool
  - human-computer interaction
  - video surveillance
  - indexing images and video databases

## History
- 1964 - 1965 = Bledsoe + Helen Chan Wolf - "man-maschine"
  - little of work published due to funding by intelligence agency
  - process
    1. landmarks manually marked on face e.g. mouth, eye centers, etc. and distances between landmarks are captured (using graphic tablet)
    2. rotated by computer for cases where the subject was in a different pose or position
    3. images matching pose variations are selected from database
  - difficulty in searching large database and the success rate of finding matching entries
  - when searching database, tilt, lean, rotation of head are attempted to be calculated and are normalized
